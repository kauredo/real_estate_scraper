## TODO

### Complex stuff

- add videos to blog post (like enterprises)

### Research

- instagram embed somewhere
- check https://nodalview.com/ to see if we can have the virtual tour in the listing (same as video)

### UI

- home page is too empty at first sight
- after advanced search/end of comprar page - have text and link to services and contact.

## DONE

- Change action "avalie a sua casa" to white on gold
- On services and about us, change action to "fale connosco" and point to contacts page
- add border to listings with status "NEW"
- merge services and house360 into one page - have "for buyer" and "for seller" sections in the page (see docs)
- enterprises - add small text from docs
- sobre nos - make changes according to docs
- ADD FAQ PAGE.
- advanced search in "comprar" - title, bedrooms, etc.
- merge /kw & /sobre, keep only /kw for SEO and title "Partnership KW" title. subtitles "Sobre Nos" and "KW Portugal", with the revised texts from the docs.
