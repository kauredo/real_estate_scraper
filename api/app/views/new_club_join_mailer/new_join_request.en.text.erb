Hi <%= @name %>,

It's official: you've just joined SGG Club!

Thank you for believing in our mission to improve housing conditions for those who truly need it.

Your registration has been successfully received.

You can read the club regulations here: https://sofiagalvaogroup.com/en/clube-sgg/regulamento.

For this mission to grow, we need you.

Here are 3 simple ways you can make a difference:

Refer people who want to buy or sell a home â€” it's through these opportunities that we're able to fund support for those who need it most.

Share Clube SGG's mission with friends and family â€” we want to build this community with people who care, just like you. And there's nothing better than bringing your loved ones along.

Send us stories of people you know who might need help â€” sometimes, change begins right next to us. We want to hear about real cases where we can step in.

You can reach us by email or WhatsApp.

Want to follow the stories of the people we're helping?

Then join our WhatsApp community! That's where we share everything first:
