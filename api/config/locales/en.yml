        title: Expectation on better return on investment
        description:
          When you buy a house on the drawing board, the investment you make is
          usually less than the investment you would have to make if it had
          already been completed. This means that your house, from the moment it
          is ready, already maximises your investment.

          Buying at the planning stage grants the future owner the chance to

          future home matches their needs and preferences.

        title: Selling a property
        questions:
          first:
            title: Why to hire Sofia Galvão Group to sell my house?
            answer:
              Selling a property is a process that requires knowledge of the
              market, promotion strategies and attention to legal and
              bureaucratic details. The Sofia Galvão Group offers a complete
              service, from the accurate assessment of the property's value to
              the final negotiation, ensuring that the client gets the best
              price and a quick and smooth sale. With extensive experience and a
              solid network of contacts, we maximise your chances of success.
          second:
            title: What are the first steps to selling my house?
            answer:
              The first step is to ensure that all the property's documentation
              is in order. This includes documents such as the land registry
              certificate, the permanent certificate, and the energy
              certificate. The Sofia Galvão Group will help you ensure that
              everything is correct and prepare a detailed evaluation to define
              the appropriate sale price.
          third:
            title: How long does the selling process take?
            answer:
              The time it takes to sell a house depends on various factors, such
              as the state of the market and the price of the property. However,
              with a personalised approach and advanced marketing strategies,
              many properties are sold in less time than the market average.
          fourth:
            title: How does Sofia Galvão Group promote my property?
            answer:
              We combine digital marketing, state of the art property platforms,
              home staging, professional photography and virtual tours. These
              techniques maximise your property's exposure to the right buyers,
              resulting in more interest and generally faster sales.
          fifth:
            title: Are there any costs associated with selling?
            answer:
              Yes. In addition to taxes, such as the Property Acquisition Tax
              (IMT) and the Stamp Duty, there are also costs for the final deed
              and the land registry. Our commission is competitive and
              transparent, covering all the services involved in promoting,
              monitoring, and managing the sales process.
      second:
        title: Buying a property
        questions:
          first:
            title: Why to choose Sofia Galvão Group to buy a house?
            answer:
              Buying a house is one of the most important financial decisions,
              and Sofia Galvão Group will ensure that you make the right choice.
              We have access to a vast network of properties, including
              exclusive ones that are not advertised on real estate portals. We
              offer support at every stage, from the search to the final
              negotiation and the signing of the final deed.
          second:
            title: What is the first step in buying a house?
            answer:
              The first step is to identify your needs and define your budget.
              Based on this, our team will help you narrow down to a suitable
              property shortlist. Once you've chosen a house, we'll guide you
              through the process of checking the documentation and preparing
              the offer.
          third:
            title: How do I know if a property is fairly priced?
            answer:
              We make a detailed assessment of the market, comparing similar
              properties in the same area. We also analyse the condition of the
              property to ensure that the asking price reflects the reality of
              the market.
          fourth:
            title: What are the costs involved in buying a house?
            answer:
              In addition to the price of the property, there are costs such as
              the Property Acquisition Tax (IMT), the Stamp Duty, the final
              deed, and the land registry. The Sofia Galvão Group helps you
              calculate all these costs to ensure you are aware of all the
              amounts involved.
          fifth:
            title: Can I get help with bank finance?
            answer:
              Sure! We have partnerships with several banks and can help you
              find the best financing conditions for your purchase.
      third:
        title: Renting a property
        questions:
          first:
            title:
              Why to choose Sofia Galvão Group to rent a house or to find
              tenants?
            answer:
              Whether you're a tenant or a landlord, Sofia Galvão Group makes
              the leasing process easier, safer and more efficient. For
              landlords, we promote the property effectively, helping to find
              the right tenant. For tenants, we ensure that the letting process
              is simple and that the property complies with all legal
              obligations.
          second:
            title: What documents are needed to rent a property?
            answer:
              In the case of tenants, documents such as proof of income, ID and,
              in some cases, a guarantor are required. In the case of landlords,
              it is important to ensure that the property has up-to-date
              documentation, including the energy certificate and the mandatory
              insurance.
          third:
            title: How is the rent determined?
            answer:
              The rent is set on the basis of a market appraisal, considering
              the location of the property and comparing it with other similar
              rentals in the area. Based on this assessment, we help you to
              define a fair and competitive value.
          fourth:
            title: Do I need a guarantor to rent a house?
            answer:
              It's not always necessary, but in some cases the landlord may
              require a guarantor as an additional guarantee. This requirement
              varies from contract to contract.
          fifth:
            title: What are the costs associated with renting?
            answer:
              For the tenant, the costs usually include two months' rent and one
              month's security deposit.
      fourth:
        title: Frequently Asked Questions
        questions:
          first:
            title: What is exclusivity in property brokerage?
            answer:
              Exclusivity means that Sofia Galvão Group will be the only company
              responsible for promoting your property, but we do not operate
              exclusively to make the sale. In order to find the best solutions
              for our clients, we work in partnership with all the real estate
              agents who have a valid brokerage license (AMI) and who may have a
              client interested in your property. This ensures that your
              property can be bought by any client looking for a home directly
              or who is being represented by a real estate consultant. However,
              the exclusive promotion allows us to devote more resources and
              attention to your property, guaranteeing a more efficient service
              and personalised follow-up until the end of the process.
          second:
            title: Can I sell and buy at the same time?
            answer:
              Sure! Our team is able to manage simultaneous sale and purchase
              processes, ensuring that the transition between properties is
              smooth and uncomplicated. We facilitate both processes, offering
              integrated solutions.
          third:
            title: What is home staging and why is it important?
            answer:
              Home staging is the preparation of a property to make it more
              attractive to potential buyers or tenants. It involves tidiness,
              decoration and small details that allow your property to stand out
              both in photos and during visits. With home staging, your property
              stands out on the market, increases its attractiveness and is
              generally sold or rented out more quickly.
          fourth:
            title:
              How long does the whole selling, buying or letting process take?
            answer:
              Times vary according to the type of transaction and market
              conditions. However, with Sofia Galvão Group's personalised
              approach, many of our clients are able to close deals in less time
              than the market average.
          fifth:
            title:
              Will the property consultant accompany me to the end of the
              process?
            answer:
              Yes. Our team is with you every step of the way, from finding or
              searching for properties, negotiating offers and even signing the
              deed or lease. This way we guarantee total support from the first
              minute to the last!
