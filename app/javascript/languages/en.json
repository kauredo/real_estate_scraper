I worked for years with brands and products, in order to better serve the Client and offer him not only what he needed, but also what best met his aspirations. I have focused on people and realising their full potential, I am a Master in Neuro Linguistic Programming and I believe in empowering people to achieve their goals and realise their life purpose. I dedicated myself to the real estate sector with a focus on the discovery of the unique asset: the house, the client, the transaction, the service. At KW I found the right structure to develop the Sofia Galvão Group's real estate brand with rigour, professionalism and trust. I have the market 'know how' and I provide my Clients the best deals, the ones that make them the happiest!",
