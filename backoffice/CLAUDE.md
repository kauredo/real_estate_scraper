## Design Context

### Users

Real estate agents managing their own client-facing websites. They come to the backoffice to update their listings, customize their site, and manage leads. They visit the promo-site when evaluating the product or signing up. These are busy professionals who need efficient tools that don't get in their way.

### Brand Personality

**Warm, approachable, helpful** — The product should feel like a supportive partner, not a complicated tool. Every interaction should reassure agents that they're making the right choice and that the software has their back.

### Emotional Goals

- **Calm & clarity**: "This is easy" — reduced stress, no overwhelm
- **Pride & professionalism**: "This makes me look good" — elevates their personal brand

### Aesthetic Direction

**Visual Tone**: Clean, friendly, and professional. Balance the minimal clarity of Notion/Linear with the visual warmth of Airbnb/Zillow.

**References**:

- Notion/Linear: Minimal, focused, excellent information hierarchy
- Airbnb/Zillow: Real estate context, visual-forward, approachable

**Anti-references** (what to avoid):

- Complex enterprise software (cluttered dashboards, overwhelming menus)
- Cheap/generic templates (stock-photo-heavy, cookie-cutter designs)
- Overly trendy/flashy (excessive animations, gratuitous gradients, dark mode gimmicks)
- Cold/corporate/sterile (clinical, impersonal, bureaucratic feel)
- AI-generated aesthetics (generic, soulless, obviously templated)

**Theme**: Light mode primary (dark mode supported in backoffice). Sky blue (#0ea5e9) as the core brand color, used sparingly for actions and emphasis.

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** — Every element should have a clear purpose. When in doubt, simplify. Reduce cognitive load at every opportunity.

2. **Warmth through details** — Use subtle rounded corners, comfortable spacing, and friendly micro-copy. The interface should feel human, not robotic.

3. **Professional by default** — The design should make agents look good to their clients. Err on the side of refined and trustworthy rather than playful.

4. **Progressive disclosure** — Show only what's needed now. Hide complexity until it's relevant. Guide users through workflows step by step.

5. **Consistency builds trust** — Use the same patterns, spacing, and interactions throughout. Predictability reduces anxiety and builds confidence.

### Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Ensure sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support for all interactive elements.

### Technical Patterns

- TailwindCSS utility-first styling
- HeadlessUI for accessible components
- FontAwesome + Heroicons for iconography
- `cn()` utility for class merging
- React 19 with TypeScript
- i18n with react-i18next (PT/EN)
- Dark mode via CSS class toggle with localStorage persistence

### Component Conventions

- Button variants: primary, secondary, danger, ghost, link
- Input variants: default, error, success (with helper text support)
- Badge variants: success, warning, error, info, neutral
- Modal sizes: sm, md, lg, xl, full
- Consistent focus rings: 2px, color-coded by context
- Border radius: rounded-lg for containers, rounded-full for badges/pills
