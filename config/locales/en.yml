# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        title: You will be the first owner of your new home
        description:
          When you buy a house on the planning stage you have the guarantee that
          the property will be move-in ready and you have the certainty that you
          will be the first owner.

        description:
          A new property has a construction guarantee, as well as the certainty
          that there will be no need for improvements in the coming years.
      perspective:
        title: Prospects of better return on investment
        description:
          When you buy a plan, the investment you make is generally lower than
          if it were already a finished house. This means that your house, once
          ready, is a boost to your investment.
      yours:
        title: Property to your measure
        description:
          The purchase in plan gives the future owner the possibility of making
          changes in terms of materials and sometimes in the configuration, so
          that your future home meets your needs and tastes.

      description:
        "I'm a trained marketer and value creator by passion. I worked for years
        with brands and products, in order to better serve the Client and offer
        him not only what he needed, but also what best met his aspirations. I
        have focused on people and realising their full potential, I am a Master
        in Neuro Linguistic Programming and I believe in empowering people to
        achieve their goals and realise their life purpose. I dedicated myself
        to the real estate sector with a focus on the discovery of the unique
        asset: the house, the client, the transaction, the service. At KW I
        found the right structure to develop the Sofia Galv√£o Group's real
        estate brand with rigour, professionalism and trust. I have the market
        'know how' and I provide my Clients the best deals, the ones that make
        them the happiest!"
