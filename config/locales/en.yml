        description:
          When you buy a plan, the investment you make is generally lower than
          if it were already a finished house. This means that your house, once
          ready, is a boost to your investment.
      yours:
        title: Property to your measure
        description:
          The purchase in plan gives the future owner the possibility of making
          changes in terms of materials and sometimes in the configuration, so
          that your future home meets your needs and tastes.

        with brands and products, in order to better serve the Client and offer

        asset: the house, the client, the transaction, the service. At KW I
        found the right structure to develop the Sofia Galvão Group's real
