          the property will be move-in ready and you have the certainty that you
          will be the first owner.

      perspective:
        title: Prospects of better return on investment
        description:
          When you buy a plan, the investment you make is generally lower than
          if it were already a finished house. This means that your house, once
          ready, is a boost to your investment.
      yours:

        description:
          The purchase in plan gives the future owner the possibility of making
          changes in terms of materials and sometimes in the configuration, so
          that your future home meets your needs and tastes.
