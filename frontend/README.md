## 🚀 Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22.x (see root `.nvmrc`)
- Backend API running (see root `README.md`)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

For production deployment on Vercel, set this in the project environment variables.

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

You can also run from the root directory:
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts API + Jobs + Frontend
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🌐 Deployment

This application is deployed to **Vercel** as the "sgg" project.

### Vercel Configuration

**Important**: The project must be configured with the correct **Root Directory**:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the sgg project → Settings → General
3. Set **Root Directory** to: `frontend`
4. Framework Preset: Vite
5. Build Command: `vite build`
6. Output Directory: `dist`
7. Install Command: `npm install`

### Environment Variables on Vercel
Set these in the Vercel project settings:
- `VITE_API_URL` - Production API URL (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1`)

### Manual Deployment
From the `frontend` directory:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Automatic Deployment
The project has `vercel.json` configured to only deploy when files in the `frontend/` directory change. Pushing to the `main` branch will trigger automatic deployment.

- All changes should be tested locally before deploying to production.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues
Ensure the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable is set correctly and the API is running.

### Build Errors
If you encounter build errors:
1. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
3. Try building again: `npm run build`

### Development Server Not Starting
Check that port 5173 is not already in use. You can change the port in `vite.config.ts` if needed.
