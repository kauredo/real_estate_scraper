# Photo Library Management Screenshot

## File: `admin-photo-library.webp`

### What to Capture
Screenshot of the **Photo Management interface** from the Sofia Galvão Group backoffice.

### Where to Navigate
1. Log into the backoffice admin panel
2. Navigate to the main dashboard
3. Click on the "Fotos" (Photos) tab
4. OR navigate directly to the photos management section

### What Should Be Visible
- Grid or list view of all photos in the library
- Photo thumbnails with metadata (name, size, date uploaded)
- Search/filter options for organizing photos
- Upload button or drag-and-drop area
- Tags, categories, or organization system
- Actions like select, delete, edit

### Screenshot Settings
- **Browser**: Desktop view (at least 1440px width)
- **Format**: WebP
- **Quality**: High (aim for 200-400KB file size)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Landscape (16:10 or similar)

### What to Avoid
- Don't show personal/sensitive client data
- Ensure you have some photos populated (not empty state)
- Remove browser UI elements

### Tips for Best Screenshot
- Populate with at least 10-20 photos to show functionality
- Show a mix of property photos
- Capture with filters/search visible if available
- Show the interface in an organized, professional state

### Alternative if Tab Not Visible
If the Photos tab is within the dashboard tabs:
- Make sure "Fotos" tab is selected
- The current AdminDashboard.tsx shows 4 tabs: Imóveis, Empreendimentos, Testemunhos, Fotos

### Once Captured
1. Save as `admin-photo-library.webp`
2. Place in `/public/images/`
3. The image will automatically replace the gradient placeholder
