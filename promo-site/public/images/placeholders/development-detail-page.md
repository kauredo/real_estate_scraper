# Development Detail Page Screenshot

## File: `development-detail-page.webp`

### What to Capture
Screenshot of a **property development/listing complex detail page** from the Sofia Galvão Group frontend.

### Where to Navigate
1. Go to the Sofia Galvão Group website
2. Navigate to the "Empreendimentos" (Developments) section
3. Click on any development to view the detail page
4. OR directly visit a URL like: `/empreendimentos/{slug}` or `/listing-complexes/{id}`

### What Should Be Visible
- Development name and main hero image
- Overview information (location, number of units, etc.)
- Photo gallery of the development
- List of individual units/properties within the development
- Features and amenities of the development
- Contact form or CTA buttons

### Screenshot Settings
- **Browser**: Desktop view (at least 1440px width)
- **Format**: WebP
- **Quality**: High (aim for 200-400KB file size)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Landscape (16:10 or similar)

### What to Avoid
- Don't include browser UI (address bar, bookmarks, etc.)
- Ensure all images are loaded before capturing
- Make sure you're logged out (public view)

### Alternative Options
If no development page exists yet:
- Use the backoffice development management page instead
- Or use a mock/prototype design
- Or keep the placeholder gradient

### Once Captured
1. Save as `development-detail-page.webp`
2. Place in `/public/images/`
3. The image will automatically replace the gradient placeholder
