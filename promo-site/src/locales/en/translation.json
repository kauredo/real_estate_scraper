        "0": {
          "question": "How do monthly plans and one-time services work together?",
          "answer": "Monthly plans cover hosting, maintenance, and support. One-time services are for initial design and build. For example: Pay €5,000 once for design + build, then €499/month for hosting and maintenance."
        },
        "1": {
          "question": "Can I just get design or build without a monthly plan?",
          "answer": "Yes! With the Developer plan (€199/month), you get API access to build your own frontend. Or purchase Design Only and build it yourself. The Professional plan (€499/month) is only needed if you want us to host and maintain your website."
        },
        "2": {
          "question": "What's included in the €5,000 Design + Build package?",
          "answer": "Complete UI/UX design for up to 5 pages, full React frontend development, CMS integration, testing, and deployment. Additional pages are €400 each. Add-ons like logo design (€800) and blog setup (€500) available."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "How long does design and build take?",
          "answer": "Typically 2-3 weeks for the complete Design + Build package. Design Only takes 1-2 weeks, Build Only takes 2 weeks."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "Can I switch plans later?",
          "answer": "Yes! You can upgrade from Developer to Professional at any time, or move between tiers as your needs change."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "What payment methods do you accept?",
          "answer": "We accept bank transfers and all major credit cards. One-time services require 50% upfront, 50% on completion. Monthly plans are billed monthly."
        },
        "6": {
          "question": "What happens if I cancel my monthly plan?",
          "answer": "You can cancel anytime with 30 days notice. Your service continues until the end of your billing period. If you paid for design/build, that work is yours to keep."
        },
        "7": {
          "question": "What are Property Developments and how do they work?",
          "answer": "Property Developments let you showcase entire residential or commercial complexes with dedicated pages. You can manage multiple units within a development, track availability, pricing per unit, and present the entire project with comprehensive details. Perfect for new construction projects or large multi-property listings."
        },
        "8": {
          "question": "How does Photo Library Management work?",
          "answer": "Our centralized photo library lets you upload, organize, and tag all your professional property photos in one place. You can then reuse these photos across multiple listings, search by tags or property, and maintain a professional asset library. This saves time and ensures consistency across your website."
        },
        "9": {
          "question": "Can I export my newsletter subscribers?",
          "answer": "Yes! With the Professional plan, you can export all your newsletter subscribers to CSV format at any time. This lets you integrate with your preferred email marketing platform (MailChimp, SendGrid, etc.) or import into your CRM for marketing campaigns."
        },
        "10": {
          "question": "What is Preview Mode and why would I use it?",
          "answer": "Preview Mode lets you review changes to listings or pages before they go live on your public website. You can generate secure preview links to share with clients for approval, ensuring everything looks perfect before publishing. It's a quality control workflow that protects your professional image."
        },
        "11": {
          "question": "Do I need technical skills to use the backoffice?",
          "answer": "No technical skills required! Our backoffice is designed for real estate agents, not developers. You can manage listings, upload photos, write blog posts, and update content through an intuitive interface. We provide training and documentation, plus email support if you need help."
